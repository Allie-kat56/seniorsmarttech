                <h3>Which smartwatch has the best fall detection for seniors?</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Apple Watch Series 10</strong> and <strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</strong> are the gold standards. They feature sophisticated algorithms that differentiate between a heavy trip and a dangerous fall, providing an essential safety net.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can a smartwatch monitor bone density?</h3>
                <p>While wrist wearables cannot yet scan bone, they are the perfect hub for that data. By using a <strong>Vitality Station</strong> (a BIA-enabled smart scale), you can monitor bone mineral content and muscle mass trends daily on your watch face.</p>
